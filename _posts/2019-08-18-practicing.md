# The importance of practicing

This is a self reminder for myself, although you may find it useful. Whenever I am just too lazy to learn/study/practice, hear these monsters to remember why investing much time to learn/practice worths it. This does not apply to only playing music, but also programming, maths, languages, sports, etc.

"Excellence comes from repetition. You wanna be good at something? Do it everyday"

"Different people may have born with different amount of giftedness. But, at the end of the day, the biggest factor is to practice"

Instead of going to the party, John Petrucci and John Myung spent their time practicing 6 hours per day.

He said he was a workaholic for no reason. That "workaholic" part when he put his finger on many devices was practicing.

# How to get started

Get started with something easy, then learn towards more difficult things. Do it step by step.

Unfortunately I forget some of the video titles that I watched about practicing. I will update as soon as I remember.
