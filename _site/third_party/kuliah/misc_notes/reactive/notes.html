<h1 id="what-is-reactive-programming">What is reactive programming</h1>
<p><strong>Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams</strong></p>

<h3 id="streams">Streams</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A stream is a sequence of ongoing events in time</li>
  <li>Anything can be a stream: variables, user inputs, properties, caches, data structures, etc.</li>
  <li>We capture these emitted events only asynchronously by defining <em>a function that will execute when a value is emitted</em> and another <em>function that will execute when an error is emitted</em>, for example.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscribing</strong>: listening to the stream</li>
  <li><strong>Observers</strong>: the function defined to observe the stream and react according to what we want it to do</li>
  <li><strong>Observable</strong>: the stream/subject that is observed.</li>
</ul>
