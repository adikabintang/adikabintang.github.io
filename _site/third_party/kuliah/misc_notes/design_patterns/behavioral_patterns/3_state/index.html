<h2 id="intent">Intent</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.</li>
  <li>An object oriented state machine</li>
  <li>wrapper + polymorphic wrappee + collaboration</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>In vending machine, the bahavior can change its behavior at runtime based on condition. When currency is deposited and a selection is made, the machine will either deliver a product and no change, deliver a product and change, deliver no product due to insufficient currency on deposit, or deliver no product due to inventory depletion.</p>
