<ul>
  <li>Assymetric encryption encrypts the message with the receiver’s public key. The receiver decrypts using the receiver’s private key.</li>
  <li>Siging encrypts the message with the sender private key. The receiver decrypts using the sender public key.</li>
</ul>

<p>Excuse me, WTF?</p>

<p>Assymetric encryption goal is confidentiality. Man in the middle cannot see the message because it has to be decrypted with the receiver’s private key.</p>

<p>Signing goal is integrity. Only the correct sender with the right private key may send the message.</p>
