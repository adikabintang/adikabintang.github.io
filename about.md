## What else...hmm...
Things that grab my attention are guitars, cloud computing and its infrastructures, computer networks & protocols, software system engineering, distributed system, Internet of Things.

From lower to higher level works: working with soldering iron to solder guitar's components and PCB for robots, coding 8 to 32-bit microcontroller, building self-service machine for hotel guests to check in, parsing QUIC protocol byte-by-byte with libpcap, automation tools with Python, virtualized servers, orchestrated containerized services, and still counting as long as I am still breathing.

You can see some of my junks in my [github](https://github.com/adikabintang).

If you think we have things in common, feel free to ask me to have a cup of coffee.
